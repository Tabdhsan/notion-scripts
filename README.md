# Notion Flix Enhance

Notion Flix Enhance is a Python program designed to enhance your media database stored in Notion by retrieving detailed information about movies and TV shows using the TMDB API. It allows you to gather essential details like directors, producers, runtime (in hours), and episode count for TV shows. This information is then added to your Notion database, along with links to watch the media and YouTube trailers.
